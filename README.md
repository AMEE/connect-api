AMEEconnect Documentation (v3)
==============================

How to get started with ameeConnect
-----------------------------------

* Sign up for API credentials at [https://www.amee.com/api](https://www.amee.com/api)
* Find the model for the activity you want to measure (i.e. transport, electricty, manufacturing processes) on [discover.amee.com](http://discover.amee.com)
* Read over the [quickstart](/sections/quickstart.md) and docs to see how to make requests for the model you're using.

How to get help
---------------

1. If there's anything that isn't clear about the API, the first place after the docs to go is the knowledge base there [help.amee.com](http://help.amee.com).

2. The next best place is either to ask on the [developer mailing list ](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/amee-developer) if you have a question you would happily share publicly. 

3. Finally the question is more suited to private conversation, you can contact our support team directly at help@amee.com.
